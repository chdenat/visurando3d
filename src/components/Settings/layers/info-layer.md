For the 2 types of layers (base and overlay) and for the terrains we offer different styles and elements.  
Some of them are completely free, so you can get started right away.  
For the others, in order to share the use of the application in a fair way, we've decided to oblige the users to manage
their own account on the site of each supplier.  
You are therefore invited to use the provider's site (by clicking on the thumbnail) to obtain the token that will allow
you to use the layers or terrains.

* **Need Account**: Some providers require you to create a free account in order to use their products.
* **Freemium**: The free usage of a layer or terrain is limited to a quota/month. Once the quota is exceeded, you can
  change for paying account or wait for the quota to be topped up.
* **Premium**: All usage is chargeable.

The tokens used to unlock access to the are stored on your browser, nowhere else.

We invite you to read carefully the **terms and conditions** of each provider.

**Disclaimer**: *The LGS1920 project is in no way affiliated with the providers.
We simply try to offer you the elements that might suit you best.  
We cannot be held responsible for expensive usage. All we do is,each time you act on the map,we send a request with your
token to the provider, and we display the information received.*
